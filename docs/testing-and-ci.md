# Testing And CI

This document is the quick map for how Kyuubiki currently validates itself in
the `tamamono 1.x` line.

## Why the test stack is layered

Kyuubiki is no longer one program. It has:

- a browser workbench
- an Elixir control plane
- Rust solver/runtime programs
- headless SDKs
- cross-process integration paths
- desktop shells

That means one flat `test everything` command is not enough context anymore.
The repository now keeps validation split by responsibility.

## Local test layers

### Core application checks

- `make test-web`
  Elixir control-plane tests under `apps/web/test`
- `make test-rust`
  Rust workspace tests under `workers/rust`
- `make test-frontend`
  frontend typecheck plus production build validation
- `make workflow-preflight`
  workflow unit/topology plus browser-backed search/layout guard validation

### SDK checks

- `make test-sdk`

This runs:

- Python SDK smoke tests
- Elixir SDK smoke tests
- Rust SDK smoke tests

These tests use small local loopback fixtures and focus on:

- `AgentClient.run_study`
- result fetch
- chunk browsing

### Cross-process integration checks

- `make test-integration`
  top-level cross-process smoke suite

The current integration family covers:

- orchestrator + Rust agents + HTTP solve flow
- sample-backed `thermal_bar_1d`, `spring_1d`, `spring_2d`, `spring_3d`, `thermal_beam_1d`, `torsion_1d`, `heat_bar_1d`, `heat_plane_triangle_2d`, `heat_plane_quad_2d`, `frame_2d`, `frame_3d`, `truss_2d`, `truss_3d`, `plane_triangle_2d`, `plane_quad_2d`, `thermal_frame_2d`, `thermal_plane_triangle_2d`, `thermal_plane_quad_2d`, `thermal_truss_2d`, `thermal_frame_3d`, and `thermal_truss_3d` orchestrated API smoke
- protected cluster register / heartbeat / unregister flow
- frontend direct-mesh LAN agent solve and chunk flow
- Workbench UI smoke split by `Mechanical` and `Thermal / Thermo-mechanical`

The full integration entrypoint list stays in:

- [tests/integration/README.md](../tests/integration/README.md)

### Desktop shell checks

- `make test-hub-gui`
- `make test-installer-gui`
- `make test-workbench-gui`

These validate the current desktop shell family without requiring a full
desktop release build.

## Unified entry points

Use these when you want the repo to choose the right lower-level commands:

- `./scripts/kyuubiki test`
- `./scripts/kyuubiki verify`
- `./scripts/kyuubiki smoke`

For narrower SDK or frontend-only entrypoints, use the package or Make targets
listed above.

For workflow-heavy frontend work, prefer the dedicated preflight entrypoint:

- `./scripts/kyuubiki workflow-preflight`

Start `npm run dev` inside `apps/frontend` first. The layout/search guard needs
the live benchmark route and is intentionally separate from `frontend-test`, so
plain build validation can stay fast and headless.

## CI structure

Current GitHub Actions jobs are intentionally separated:

- `web-test`
- `rust-test`
- `frontend-test`
- `sdk-smoke`
- `integration-smoke-api`
- `integration-smoke-cluster`
- `integration-smoke-direct-mesh`
- `hub-gui-smoke`
- `installer-gui-smoke`
- `workbench-gui-smoke`

## Direct-mesh Docker regression lane

The repository now keeps a dedicated direct-mesh Docker regression path for the
shared LAN solver setup.

Use these entrypoints:

- `make test-integration-direct-mesh-docker`
  Run the Docker direct-mesh benchmark locally or from an operator shell.
- `make test-integration-direct-mesh-docker-compare CURRENT=tmp/direct-mesh-benchmark-container/latest/summary.json`
  Compare an existing benchmark summary against the checked-in baseline.
- `make test-integration-direct-mesh-docker-report REPEAT=3`
  Run a fresh benchmark and emit comparison artifacts beside the summary.
- `make test-integration-direct-mesh-docker-nightly`
  Run the remote `kyuubiki-lab` regression wrapper and fail on threshold regressions.

Baseline and report surfaces:

- baseline snapshot:
  [tests/integration/benchmarks/direct-mesh-docker-baseline.json](../tests/integration/benchmarks/direct-mesh-docker-baseline.json)
- local/latest benchmark output:
  `tmp/direct-mesh-benchmark-container/latest/summary.json`
- local/latest comparison report:
  `tmp/direct-mesh-benchmark-container/latest/compare.md`

Current behavior notes:

- direct-mesh Docker runtime defaults to `DOCKER_RUN_NETWORK=host`
- remote nightly execution assumes a self-hosted runner on the same LAN
- the remote lab wrapper expects a narrow passwordless sudo rule for the
  direct-mesh benchmark command path only

## Failure diagnostics

Integration jobs now provide two failure surfaces:

- uploaded `tmp/run` artifacts
- a GitHub Actions job summary with:
  - discovered runtime logs
  - high-signal error lines
  - log tail excerpts

This is meant to reduce the number of failures that require artifact download
before they become understandable.

## Recommended local sequence

For most nontrivial changes:

1. Run the smallest focused test first.
2. Run the relevant layer command.
3. Run `make verify` before wrapping the work.

Typical examples:

- UI/runtime protocol change:
  `make test-frontend && make test-sdk`
- workflow builder or operator-search UI change:
  `make workflow-preflight`
- orchestrator behavior change:
  `make test-web && make test-integration-api`
- SDK-only change:
  `make test-sdk`
- desktop-shell change:
  `make test-workbench-gui`
